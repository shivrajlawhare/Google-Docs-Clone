## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-docs-clone.git
    cd google-docs-clone
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file and add your environment variables:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<your-clerk-frontend-api>
    CLERK_API_KEY=<your-clerk-api-key>
    LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=<your-liveblocks-secret-key>
    ```

4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Challenges Faced

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Setting up real-time collaboration using Liveblocks was challenging but rewarding. It involved ensuring that multiple users could edit documents without conflicts.
  
- **Authentication**: Integrating Clerk for user authentication required careful handling of user sessions and permissions.

- **UI Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent and responsive UI across different devices was also a key challenge.

## Future Enhancements

- **Offline Mode**: Allowing users to edit documents offline and sync later.
- **Version Control**: Implementing version history and rollback.
